  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the steps required to establish an urban rooftop farming operation on a commercial building. It involves assessing structural integrity, selecting suitable crops for rooftop conditions, designing irrigation and nutrient delivery systems, obtaining necessary permits, installing solar-powered sensors for environmental monitoring, and launching a community engagement program to promote local produce. The process also incorporates waste recycling protocols, pest management without chemicals, and continuous yield optimization through data analysis, ensuring sustainability and profitability in an unconventional agriculture setting within a dense urban environment.",
