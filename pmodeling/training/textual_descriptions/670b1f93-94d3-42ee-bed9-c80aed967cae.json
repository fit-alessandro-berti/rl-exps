  "description": "This process orchestrates the systematic fusion of ideas from disparate industries to generate breakthrough products. It begins with trend spotting across unrelated sectors, followed by interdisciplinary brainstorming sessions. Concepts are prototyped using agile sprints, then undergo cross-functional peer reviews to identify unforeseen synergies. After iterative refinements, pilot launches are conducted in niche markets to collect diverse user feedback. The insights gained inform strategic pivots and scaling decisions. Throughout, knowledge management ensures lessons learned are archived for future cycles, fostering continuous evolution and competitive advantage in rapidly shifting markets.",
