  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of an urban vertical farming system within a repurposed commercial building. It involves site analysis, modular system design, climate control setup, nutrient solution preparation, seed selection, automated planting, real-time environment monitoring, pest control without chemicals, energy optimization, crop growth tracking, harvest scheduling, yield analysis, waste recycling, packaging design, and distribution logistics. The process integrates sustainable technologies and data-driven decision making to maximize crop yield in limited urban spaces while minimizing environmental impact and operational costs.",
