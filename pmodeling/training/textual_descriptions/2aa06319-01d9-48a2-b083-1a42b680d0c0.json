  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and highly specialized steps required to establish a fully operational urban vertical farming system. It begins with site analysis and continues through modular assembly, hydroponic system integration, automated climate control calibration, nutrient solution formulation, and real-time crop monitoring. The process also involves managing energy consumption, pest prevention protocols, staff training on vertical farming technology, and the implementation of AI-driven yield optimization. Finally, the system undergoes rigorous testing before commercial crop production begins, ensuring sustainability, efficiency, and high-quality output in an urban environment.",
