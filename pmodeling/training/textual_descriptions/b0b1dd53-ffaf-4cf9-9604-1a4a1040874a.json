  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process involves a systematic approach to generating novel solutions by integrating insights from diverse industries. It starts with environmental scanning to identify emerging trends, followed by cross-sector brainstorming sessions. Ideas are then prototyped rapidly using agile methods and tested through simulated market environments. Feedback loops include stakeholder validation and cross-disciplinary peer reviews. The process culminates in iterative refinement and strategic alignment before final deployment, ensuring innovation is both disruptive and viable across multiple markets and regulatory frameworks.",
