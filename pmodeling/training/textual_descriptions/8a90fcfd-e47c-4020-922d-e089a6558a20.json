  "description": "This process outlines the setup of an urban vertical farming system within a constrained city environment. It involves selecting suitable building structures, integrating hydroponic and aeroponic technologies, optimizing energy consumption with renewable sources, and establishing automated monitoring for nutrient delivery and climate control. The process also includes compliance with local zoning laws, community engagement for sustainable practices, and iterative testing of crop yields under varying light and humidity conditions to maximize productivity while minimizing ecological footprint.",
