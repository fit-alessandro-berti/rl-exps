It begins with initial assessment, followed by detailed documentation of damage and provenance verification. Specialized cleaning techniques are applied to remove years of grime without harming original finishes. Structural repairs require precise woodworking or metalwork to preserve authenticity. Acoustic tuning is performed to balance sound quality. Custom replacement parts are fabricated when originals are unavailable, ensuring historical accuracy. Final polishing enhances aesthetic appeal, while quality control verifies functionality. The process concludes with archival recording of restoration details and client handover, maintaining a comprehensive history for collectors and musicians alike.",
