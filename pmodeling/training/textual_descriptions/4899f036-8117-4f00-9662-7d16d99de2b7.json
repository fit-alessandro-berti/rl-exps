It involves evaluating structural integrity, securing permits, sourcing organic soil and seeds, designing efficient irrigation systems, integrating renewable energy solutions, coordinating with local suppliers, managing seasonal crop rotation, and implementing pest control without chemicals. Continuous monitoring of plant health and environmental data is essential. Additionally, the process requires community engagement initiatives and educational workshops to promote urban agriculture awareness and participation. The entire workflow balances regulatory compliance, environmental sustainability, and economic viability, ensuring the rooftop farm thrives as a model of urban green innovation.",
