  "title": "Drone Fleet Asset Reallocation",
  "description": "This process governs the strategic redeployment of a fleet of autonomous drones across multiple urban zones to optimize delivery efficiency and battery usage. It involves real-time traffic and weather data integration, predictive maintenance scheduling, dynamic load balancing, and regulatory compliance verification. The process begins with data aggregation and risk assessment, followed by route recalculations and asset prioritization based on demand forecasts. It includes emergency override protocols and end-of-day performance reporting for continuous improvement and stakeholder review. Coordination with local authorities and integration with other logistics systems ensure seamless operation in a complex urban environment.",
