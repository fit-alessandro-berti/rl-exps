  "title": "Artisan Microbrew Launch",
  "description": "This process details the launch of a niche artisan microbrewery that integrates traditional brewing methods with advanced sensory analytics to create limited edition craft beers. It begins with ingredient sourcing from rare local farms, followed by small-batch brewing cycles tailored through AI-driven recipe adjustments. The process includes sensory panel evaluations, iterative recipe refinement, custom label design reflecting the beer's origin story, and eco-friendly packaging development. Marketing involves engaging local communities via pop-up tastings and digital storytelling campaigns. Finally, distribution leverages a hybrid model combining boutique retail partnerships and direct-to-consumer subscription services, ensuring exclusivity and continuous feedback loops for future batches.",
