  "title": "Crowdsourced Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process involves leveraging a global crowd to generate, refine, and implement innovative solutions for complex business challenges. It starts with problem framing and crowdsourcing ideas through an open platform, followed by multi-stage evaluation, collaborative prototyping, and iterative testing. The process incorporates community voting, expert moderation, and real-time feedback loops to ensure quality and relevance. Successful prototypes undergo pilot deployment with select users, data-driven performance analysis, and scaling strategies. It closes with knowledge capture and incentivization to sustain continual engagement and innovation momentum within diverse stakeholder ecosystems.",
