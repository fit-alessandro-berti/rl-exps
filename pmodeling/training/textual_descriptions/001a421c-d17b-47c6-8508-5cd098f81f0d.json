  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process involves transforming underutilized urban rooftop spaces into productive, sustainable farms. It includes structural assessment to ensure load-bearing capacity, environmental analysis for sunlight and wind patterns, selection of appropriate soil and hydroponic systems, installation of automated irrigation and nutrient delivery, integration of sensor networks for real-time monitoring, community engagement for education and maintenance, and finally, planning for seasonal crop rotation and pest management strategies. The process is designed to maximize green space in cities while promoting local food production and reducing carbon footprints through innovative urban agriculture techniques.",
