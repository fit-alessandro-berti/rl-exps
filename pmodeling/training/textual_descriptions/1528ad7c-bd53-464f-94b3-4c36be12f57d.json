  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process describes the complex and atypical steps involved in establishing a fully operational urban vertical farm within a repurposed industrial building. It encompasses site assessment, modular structure design, climate control calibration, advanced hydroponic system installation, sensor network deployment for real-time monitoring, and integration with renewable energy sources. The process also includes staff training on specialized equipment, compliance with urban agriculture regulations, yield forecasting using AI analytics, and establishing distribution channels targeting local markets. This ensures sustainable food production in limited city spaces while optimizing resource efficiency and minimizing environmental impact.",
