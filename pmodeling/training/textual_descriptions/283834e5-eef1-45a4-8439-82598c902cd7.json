  "title": "Cross-Platform Data Arbitration",
  "description": "This process involves the automated arbitration of conflicting data inputs from multiple decentralized sources to ensure a unified and validated dataset. It begins with data ingestion from disparate platforms, followed by normalization and conflict detection. Once conflicts are identified, arbitration rules apply weighted logic based on source reliability, timeliness, and historical accuracy. The process includes iterative reconciliation cycles with human oversight for ambiguous cases, finally updating the master dataset and triggering notifications for downstream systems. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops refine arbitration parameters over time, enhancing data integrity across complex ecosystems.",
