  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive steps required to establish and operate an urban vertical farming facility within a repurposed industrial building. It involves initial site analysis, structural modification, installation of climate control and hydroponic systems, integration of IoT sensors for real-time monitoring, seed selection and planting, nutrient delivery optimization, pest management using biological controls, automated harvesting, data-driven yield analysis, packaging, and distribution logistics tailored for local markets. The process emphasizes sustainability through energy-efficient practices and waste recycling, ensuring minimal environmental impact while maximizing crop output and quality in limited urban spaces.",
