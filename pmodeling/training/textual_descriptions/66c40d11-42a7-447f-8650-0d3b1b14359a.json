  "title": "Custom Artifact Authentication",
  "description": "This process involves the complex validation and authentication of rare cultural artifacts sourced globally. It encompasses provenance research, multi-layered material analysis, expert consensus, and legal compliance verification. Each artifact undergoes detailed historical cross-referencing, advanced chemical testing, and digital imaging before final certification. The process also includes stakeholder coordination spanning archaeologists, legal advisors, and auction houses, ensuring authenticity, ethical acquisition, and traceability. Post-authentication, artifacts are cataloged with secure blockchain entries to prevent forgery, and continuous monitoring for ownership disputes is maintained, integrating international regulatory updates and client feedback loops.",
