  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and multi-disciplinary steps required to establish a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It involves assessing structural integrity, securing permits, designing modular planting systems, integrating smart irrigation, sourcing organic seeds, coordinating with local suppliers, training staff, and establishing distribution channels for fresh produce. The process also includes continuous monitoring of plant health using IoT sensors, adjusting nutrient delivery, managing waste composting, and engaging the community through workshops and events. This atypical but increasingly relevant business process combines agriculture, technology, and urban planning to transform unused rooftop spaces into productive green areas that contribute to local food security and environmental sustainability.",
