  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process describes a cyclical approach where multiple industries collaborate to innovate a shared technology platform. It begins with trend spotting in diverse sectors, followed by ideation sessions that mix domain experts. Prototypes are co-developed and tested in controlled pilot environments across industries. Feedback loops involve multi-disciplinary review boards, adapting the product for specific market needs. Parallel regulatory assessments ensure compliance across jurisdictions. After iterative refinement, a joint go-to-market strategy is launched, including synchronized branding and distribution channels. Post-launch monitoring collects cross-sector data to inform the next innovation cycle, fostering sustainable competitive advantage through continuous, collaborative evolution.",
