  "title": "Artisan Cheese Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process details the artisanal cheese supply chain involving small-scale farm production, quality fermentation, aging, and niche market distribution. It starts with milk sourcing from rare breed cows, followed by precise curd formation and hand-pressing techniques. The cheeses undergo microclimate-controlled aging, with periodic manual inspections and flavor profiling. Packaging uses biodegradable materials with custom labeling. The distribution leverages local gourmet shops and direct farmer-to-chef deliveries, requiring coordination with logistics providers for temperature-controlled transport. Feedback loops involve tasting panels and customer surveys to refine future batches, ensuring a consistent premium product that preserves traditional methods while meeting modern sustainability standards.",
