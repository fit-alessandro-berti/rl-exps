  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and multidisciplinary steps required to establish a sustainable urban rooftop farming system. It involves site assessment for structural integrity, microclimate analysis, soil and water testing, design of modular planting beds, installation of automated irrigation and nutrient delivery systems, integration of renewable energy sources, implementation of pest management strategies, staff training on urban agriculture techniques, and ongoing monitoring of crop health and yield. The process also includes community engagement to promote urban farming awareness, securing permits and compliance with local regulations, and establishing supply chains for distribution. This atypical but realistic process ensures efficient utilization of rooftop spaces to produce fresh, local food in densely populated urban environments.",
