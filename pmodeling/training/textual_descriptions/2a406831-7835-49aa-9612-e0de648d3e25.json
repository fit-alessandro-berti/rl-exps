  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex establishment of an urban vertical farm within a dense city environment. It involves site assessment, modular system design, environmental impact evaluation, securing permits, sourcing specialized hydroponic equipment, installing automated climate controls, integrating AI-driven nutrient delivery, recruiting skilled agronomists, conducting pilot crop trials, optimizing energy consumption, establishing local distribution channels, and implementing continuous monitoring for yield maximization and sustainability compliance. The goal is to create a scalable, high-efficiency farming solution that minimizes footprint while maximizing fresh produce output year-round in urban settings.",
