  "title": "Dynamic Artifact Licensing",
  "description": "This process manages the licensing of digital artifacts that are dynamically created and modified based on user interactions and environmental conditions. It involves capturing artifact metadata, verifying usage rights in real-time, negotiating adaptive license terms with multiple stakeholders, executing smart contracts, monitoring ongoing compliance through automated audits, and dynamically updating license conditions as artifacts evolve. The process ensures secure distribution, handles dispute resolution via decentralized arbitration, and integrates with external content management systems to synchronize license statuses. It also involves periodic reporting to licensors and licensees, enabling transparent usage tracking and payment settlements based on actual consumption patterns. This atypical licensing workflow combines legal, technical, and operational activities to support continuously changing digital assets in a robust, scalable, and compliant manner.",
