  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban vertical farm within a densely populated city. It includes site analysis, modular design, environmental control calibration, nutrient cycling optimization, and integration of AI-driven monitoring systems. The process ensures minimal resource consumption by recycling water and organic waste, supports continuous crop growth through automated lighting schedules, and involves community engagement for local produce distribution. Additionally, it addresses regulatory compliance, supply chain logistics, and scalability assessment to adapt to changing urban demands, making it an atypical yet highly realistic business model in modern agriculture.",
