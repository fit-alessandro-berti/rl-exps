  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and atypical steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farming operation within a constrained city environment. It includes initial site evaluation, modular system design, climate control calibration, nutrient optimization, and automated harvesting integration. The process further involves stakeholder engagement for local sourcing, regulatory compliance checks, energy consumption analysis, waste recycling protocols, and real-time growth monitoring through IoT sensors. Each activity ensures sustainability, scalability, and community impact while addressing unique urban agricultural challenges such as space limitations and environmental factors, making this a multifaceted and innovative business endeavor.",
