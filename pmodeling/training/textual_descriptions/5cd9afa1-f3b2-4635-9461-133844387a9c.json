  "title": "Custom Artifact Authentication",
  "description": "This process involves the intricate validation and certification of rare cultural artifacts using a multi-disciplinary approach. It begins with provenance review, followed by material analysis using advanced spectroscopy. Next, experts conduct stylistic and historical cross-referencing. Digital watermarking is applied for future tracking. Legal clearances are obtained through international heritage law offices. Finally, a tamper-evident seal is issued and logged in a decentralized ledger, ensuring authenticity and preventing illicit trade. The entire workflow requires coordination across legal, scientific, and archival domains to maintain integrity and trust in the artifact authentication process.",
