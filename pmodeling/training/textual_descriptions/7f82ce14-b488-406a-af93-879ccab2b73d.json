  "title": "Urban Vertical Farm Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of an urban vertical farm within a densely populated city environment. It involves specialized steps including site assessment for structural integrity, climate control system design tailored to microclimates, modular hydroponic installation, custom nutrient formula development, and integration of AI-driven crop monitoring. The process further incorporates community engagement for sustainable sourcing, waste recycling through bio-composting, and adaptive lighting schedules to optimize growth cycles. Each activity ensures the farm operates efficiently while minimizing environmental impact and maximizing yield in limited urban space.",
