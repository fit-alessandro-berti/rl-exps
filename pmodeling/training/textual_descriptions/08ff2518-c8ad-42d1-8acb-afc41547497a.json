  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the intricate steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm within a densely populated city environment. It includes site analysis, regulatory compliance, modular system design, climate control calibration, nutrient cycling optimization, and community integration. The process requires coordination among agronomists, engineers, local authorities, and marketing teams to ensure sustainability, crop yield maximization, and economic viability while minimizing environmental impact in constrained urban spaces. It culminates in continuous monitoring and adaptive management to respond to urban challenges such as pollution, limited sunlight, and water reuse.",
