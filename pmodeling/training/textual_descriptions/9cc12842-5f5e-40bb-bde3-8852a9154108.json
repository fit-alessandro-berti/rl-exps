  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of an urban vertical farm within a repurposed commercial building. It involves site analysis, modular rack installation, hydroponic system integration, nutrient cycling optimization, environmental control calibration, automated pest detection, crop scheduling, data-driven yield forecasting, waste recycling, energy consumption monitoring, and community engagement to ensure sustainability and profitability in a constrained urban environment. The process balances technology deployment with ecological principles and local regulations to create a scalable food production model that addresses urban food deserts and reduces supply chain emissions.",
