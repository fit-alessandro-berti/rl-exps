  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Cycle",
  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive cycle of urban vertical farming, integrating advanced hydroponic techniques, environmental monitoring, and automated harvesting. Beginning with seed selection and nutrient calibration, it includes precision climate control, pest detection using AI sensors, and adaptive lighting schedules to optimize plant growth. Post-harvest, produce is quality-checked, packaged, and distributed via local delivery networks, ensuring minimal environmental footprint and fresh supply. The process also incorporates waste recycling and energy recapture to create a sustainable closed-loop system, balancing technological innovation with ecological responsibility in dense urban environments.",
