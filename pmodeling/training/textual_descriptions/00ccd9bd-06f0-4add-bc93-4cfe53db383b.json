  "title": "Quantum Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process involves integrating quantum computing algorithms into traditional supply chain management to optimize inventory, forecasting, and logistics dynamically in real-time. The workflow incorporates quantum data encryption, probabilistic demand modeling, and adaptive routing that reacts to environmental changes and market volatility instantly. It also includes cross-border regulatory compliance checks using AI-driven legal scanners and blockchain verification, ensuring secure and transparent transactions across multiple stakeholders. The process ends with continuous feedback loops from IoT sensors and predictive maintenance schedules, enabling proactive risk mitigation and sustainable resource allocation.",
