  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process involves establishing a vertical farming system within an urban environment, integrating advanced hydroponic and aeroponic technologies. It begins with site assessment and structural retrofitting, followed by environmental control installation, nutrient cycling design, and seed selection tailored to urban microclimates. The process includes IoT sensor deployment for real-time monitoring, automated irrigation calibration, pest management via integrated biological controls, and workforce training for operational maintenance. Finally, it covers yield forecasting using AI analytics and establishing supply chain logistics focused on rapid distribution to local markets, ensuring sustainability and minimal carbon footprint throughout the lifecycle.",
