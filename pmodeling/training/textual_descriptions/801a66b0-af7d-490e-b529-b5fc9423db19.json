  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Cycle",
  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive cycle of managing an urban vertical farm, integrating technology, sustainability, and logistics. It includes stages from environmental monitoring and seed selection to nutrient balancing and automated harvesting. The process accounts for real-time data analysis, pest control without chemicals, energy optimization using renewable sources, and distribution logistics tailored for fresh produce delivery within city limits. Additionally, it incorporates waste recycling and community engagement efforts, ensuring a closed-loop system that maximizes yield while minimizing ecological footprint and operational costs.",
