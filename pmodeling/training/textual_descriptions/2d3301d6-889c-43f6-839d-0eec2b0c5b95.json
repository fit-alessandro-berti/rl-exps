  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process describes the complex and multifaceted steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm in a densely populated city. It begins with site analysis and zoning approval, followed by modular structure design and climate system integration. The process continues with nutrient solution preparation, automated seeding, and lighting calibration. Maintenance routines include pest monitoring and system diagnostics, while data analytics optimize growth cycles. Finally, the harvest scheduling and distribution logistics ensure fresh produce delivery within tight urban supply chains, balancing sustainability with commercial viability in constrained spaces.",
