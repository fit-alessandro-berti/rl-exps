  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm in a dense metropolitan area. It includes initial site assessment, securing permits, soil testing, modular bed construction, irrigation system design, selecting climate-resilient crops, integrating renewable energy sources, pest management planning, community engagement, and ongoing yield optimization. The workflow balances environmental, regulatory, and social factors to promote urban agriculture as a viable food source while minimizing ecological footprint and maximizing space utilization on rooftops with structural and safety constraints.",
