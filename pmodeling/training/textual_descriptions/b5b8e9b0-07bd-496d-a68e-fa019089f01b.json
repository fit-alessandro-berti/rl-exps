  "title": "Artisan Microbrew Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process outlines the end-to-end supply chain management of a small-scale artisan microbrewery that specializes in rare hop varieties and seasonal brews. It involves sourcing unique ingredients from remote farms, custom fermentation monitoring, small-batch quality control, adaptive packaging design, and direct-to-consumer distribution through niche channels. The process integrates traditional brewing techniques with modern IoT sensors for environment regulation, includes community feedback loops for recipe refinement, and leverages sustainable logistics practices to minimize carbon footprint while maintaining artisanal quality and exclusivity in the craft beer market.",
