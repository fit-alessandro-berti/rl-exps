  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and atypical steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm. It begins with site analysis to assess structural integrity and sunlight exposure, followed by securing permits and community engagement to ensure regulatory compliance and local support. Next, soil testing and hydroponic system design are tailored to urban constraints. Procurement involves sourcing lightweight, eco-friendly materials and heirloom seeds. Installation includes modular bed assembly, irrigation setup, and sensor integration for climate control. Subsequent activities focus on planting, pest management using organic methods, and continuous monitoring via IoT devices. Harvesting is scheduled in phases to optimize yield, followed by distribution through local markets and restaurants. The process concludes with seasonal evaluation and planning for crop rotation to maintain soil health and sustainability.",
