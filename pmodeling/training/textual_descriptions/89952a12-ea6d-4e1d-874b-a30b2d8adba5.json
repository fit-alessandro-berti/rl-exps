  "title": "Adaptive Art Auction",
  "description": "This process governs the dynamic auctioning of digital and physical artworks utilizing real-time AI valuation combined with bidder sentiment analysis. Initially, artworks undergo provenance verification and condition assessment before entering the auction pool. The system then applies AI-driven price forecasting while monitoring bidder engagement through behavioral analytics. During live bidding, the auction adapts increment increments and time extensions based on participant activity and sentiment shifts detected via social media integration. Post-auction, ownership transfer is automated through blockchain registration, while artist royalties and secondary sales rights are calculated and distributed. Finally, comprehensive auction performance reports are generated for stakeholders, incorporating predictive insights for future events to optimize revenue and engagement.",
