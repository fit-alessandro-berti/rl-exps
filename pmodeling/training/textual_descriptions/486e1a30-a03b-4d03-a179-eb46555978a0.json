  "title": "Emerging Market Product Launch",
  "description": "This process involves launching a new product specifically tailored for emerging markets where infrastructure, consumer behavior, and regulatory environments differ significantly from developed regions. It starts with localized market research and cultural adaptation, followed by modular product design to accommodate varying supply chain constraints. Parallel activities include securing local partnerships, navigating complex import regulations, and performing risk assessments on geopolitical factors. Marketing strategies are co-created with regional influencers and pilot campaigns are run in select urban and rural areas. Continuous feedback loops ensure iterative product refinement. The process culminates in scalable distribution network setup, compliance audits, and cross-border payment integration, ensuring a sustainable entry and growth within these dynamic markets.",
