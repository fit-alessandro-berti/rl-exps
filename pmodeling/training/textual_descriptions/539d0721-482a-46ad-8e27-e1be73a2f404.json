  "description": "This process outlines a quantum-enhanced supply chain system where quantum computing optimizes inventory forecasting and logistics in real-time. It begins with demand sensing through quantum sensors, followed by entangled data verification and quantum encryption for secure transactions. The process integrates quantum machine learning to predict disruptions, dynamically re-routing shipments using quantum algorithms. Supplier contracts are negotiated using quantum secure channels, while quantum simulators test production scenarios. The process concludes with a quantum audit ensuring transparency and compliance, enabling ultra-efficient and resilient supply chain management beyond classical capabilities.",
