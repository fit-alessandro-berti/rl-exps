  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Cycle",
  "description": "This process details the comprehensive cycle of managing an urban vertical farm that integrates IoT sensors, AI-driven analytics, and automated hydroponic systems to optimize crop yield year-round. Starting from environmental setup and seed selection, the process includes nutrient mixing, growth monitoring, pest detection via drones, adaptive lighting control, and harvesting automation. Post-harvest activities encompass quality sorting, packaging using biodegradable materials, and distribution logistics tailored for city-based delivery. The process also incorporates sustainability checks, energy consumption audits, and community engagement initiatives to ensure ecological balance and social impact within the urban farming ecosystem.",
