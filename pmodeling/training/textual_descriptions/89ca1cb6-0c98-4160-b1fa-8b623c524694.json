  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm within a dense city environment. It includes site analysis, modular system design, climate control calibration, nutrient cycling optimization, and community integration strategies. The process requires coordinating multidisciplinary teams to address challenges such as limited space, energy efficiency, waste management, and crop selection tailored for vertical growth. Continuous monitoring and adaptive adjustments ensure sustainable yield and environmental compliance, ultimately fostering local food production in urban settings.",
