It includes identifying niche influencers, negotiating collaborations, scheduling synchronized content releases, monitoring real-time engagement metrics, managing cross-platform content adaptations, and handling regulatory compliance checks for advertising standards. The process also requires crisis management protocols for negative feedback, iterative optimization based on analytics, and final reporting to stakeholders.
