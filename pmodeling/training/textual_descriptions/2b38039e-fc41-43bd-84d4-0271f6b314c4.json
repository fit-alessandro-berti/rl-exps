  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process involves the systematic identification, adaptation, and integration of innovative practices across unrelated industries to foster breakthrough product development. It begins with market scanning for emerging trends outside the company's sector, followed by feasibility assessments incorporating cross-disciplinary expert panels. Next, pilot projects are initiated to adapt external innovations, supported by iterative feedback loops involving prototype testing, user experience evaluation, and scalability analysis. The process also includes knowledge transfer sessions to internal teams, regulatory compliance reviews tailored to new application contexts, and strategic alignment workshops to ensure innovation fits the company\u2019s long-term goals. Finally, successful innovations undergo full-scale deployment supported by change management and performance monitoring, creating a continuous loop that enhances competitive advantage through unconventional knowledge fusion.",
