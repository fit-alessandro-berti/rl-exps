  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farming system within a densely populated city environment. It includes site analysis, modular structure design, climate control integration, hydroponic system installation, nutrient solution calibration, automated monitoring setup, waste recycling strategy, and stakeholder coordination. The process also covers regulatory compliance checks, energy consumption optimization, pest control protocols, crop selection based on urban microclimates, data analytics for yield prediction, continuous maintenance scheduling, and market distribution planning. This atypical but realistic process ensures sustainable and efficient urban agriculture leveraging advanced technology and interdisciplinary collaboration.",
