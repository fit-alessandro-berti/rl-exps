  "title": "Custom Artifact Provenance Verification",
  "description": "This process involves the comprehensive verification of an artifact's authenticity and provenance by integrating multidisciplinary data sources including historical records, material analysis, expert consultations, and blockchain-based ownership tracking. The workflow begins with initial artifact intake, followed by surface and chemical scans, detailed archival research, cross-referencing ownership documents, and consulting domain specialists. Next, the process incorporates advanced AI pattern recognition to detect anomalies, compares findings with known databases, and consolidates all evidence into a digital dossier. Finally, the process concludes with certification issuance or rejection, ensuring traceability and transparency in the art and antiquities market while mitigating forgery risks and enhancing collector confidence.",
