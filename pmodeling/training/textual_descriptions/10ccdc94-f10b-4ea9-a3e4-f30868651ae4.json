  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing an urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It begins with structural assessment and legal compliance checks, followed by soil and water testing. Selection of plant varieties suitable for rooftop conditions is critical, alongside the installation of irrigation and drainage systems. The process also includes microclimate monitoring, pest control strategies tailored to urban environments, and community engagement for educational programs. Finally, ongoing maintenance schedules and yield optimization through data analytics complete the setup, ensuring a sustainable and productive rooftop farm in a dense cityscape.",
