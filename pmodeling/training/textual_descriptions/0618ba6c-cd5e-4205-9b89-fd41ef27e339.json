  "description": "This process outlines a dynamic and iterative approach to entering new international markets where traditional linear strategies are insufficient. It combines real-time market sensing, rapid prototyping of localized offerings, continuous stakeholder feedback loops, regulatory navigation, and adaptive resource allocation to optimize market fit and minimize entry risks. The process involves cross-functional collaboration between marketing, legal, product development, and local partners, ensuring responsiveness to emerging challenges and opportunities. It requires constant data-driven adjustments to the go-to-market plan based on evolving customer preferences, competitor moves, and regulatory changes, ultimately enabling faster and more sustainable market penetration in volatile environments.",
