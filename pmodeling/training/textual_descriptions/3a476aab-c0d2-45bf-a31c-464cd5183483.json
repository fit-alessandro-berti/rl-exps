  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the unconventional approach of establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a high-rise building. It involves site assessment, structural analysis, soil preparation, microclimate optimization, planting, automated irrigation setup, pest control using integrated biological methods, crop monitoring via drones, community engagement for education, harvesting, yield analysis, and finally, distribution logistics tailored for urban markets. The process requires coordination among architects, agronomists, engineers, and local authorities to ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards while maximizing crop output and minimizing resource usage, making it a complex yet innovative business model for urban agriculture.",
