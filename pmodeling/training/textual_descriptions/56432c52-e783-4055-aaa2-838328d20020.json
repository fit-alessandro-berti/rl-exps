  "title": "Artisanal Cheese Export",
  "description": "This process involves sourcing rare milk varieties from remote farms, conducting quality certification through microbiological testing, and aging cheese in controlled cave environments. Packaging requires custom humidity-controlled containers before coordinating multi-modal transport logistics including refrigerated sea freight. Customs clearance demands specialized documentation due to dairy export restrictions. The final step includes retailer training on product handling and shelf-life optimization to ensure premium quality upon delivery.",
