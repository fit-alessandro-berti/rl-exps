  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It includes site assessment, structural analysis, soil preparation using hydroponic techniques, and installation of automated irrigation systems. The process also covers regulatory compliance checks, sourcing of organic seeds, pest control planning, and community engagement for local produce distribution. Continuous monitoring of crop health through IoT sensors and data analytics ensures optimal growth conditions while minimizing resource use. Finally, the process integrates seasonal crop rotation planning and waste recycling protocols to maintain long-term farm productivity and environmental sustainability.",
