  "title": "Urban Vertical Farm Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of a fully automated urban vertical farm designed to optimize space and resource efficiency in metropolitan areas. It involves site analysis, modular structure assembly, IoT sensor integration for real-time monitoring, adaptive lighting calibration, hydroponic nutrient cycling, AI-driven pest detection, and dynamic crop rotation scheduling. The workflow also includes local community collaboration for produce distribution, sustainability compliance checks, energy consumption optimization, and post-harvest quality assurance to ensure fresh, pesticide-free yield year-round within confined urban environments.",
