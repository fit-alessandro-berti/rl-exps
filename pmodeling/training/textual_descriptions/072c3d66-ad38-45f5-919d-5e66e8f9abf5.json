  "title": "Antique Restoration Workflow",
  "description": "This process involves the meticulous restoration of antique furniture and artifacts to preserve their historical and aesthetic value. It begins with detailed condition assessment, followed by documentation and research on the item's provenance. The workflow includes careful disassembly, cleaning using specialized solvents, and stabilization of fragile components. Surface treatments such as paint consolidation or veneer repair are applied next. After structural repairs, the piece undergoes controlled drying and curing phases. The process also involves selective inpainting or gilding to restore visual continuity while respecting original materials. Finally, the item is reassembled, given a protective finish, and subjected to quality inspection before being returned to the client or museum. Each step requires specialized skills and adherence to conservation ethics to ensure authenticity and longevity.",
