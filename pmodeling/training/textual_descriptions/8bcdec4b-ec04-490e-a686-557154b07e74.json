  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It includes site analysis considering structural integrity and sunlight exposure, procurement of specialized soil and hydroponic systems, coordination with city authorities for permits, installation of irrigation and energy-efficient lighting, selection and planting of diverse crops suited for urban climates, ongoing monitoring for pest control using organic methods, integration of data-driven growth analytics, and finally, the distribution of produce through local markets and community-supported agriculture programs. The process requires collaboration between architects, agronomists, environmental engineers, and logistics teams to ensure a viable, eco-friendly, and profitable urban farming operation.",
