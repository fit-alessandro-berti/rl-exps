  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the steps required to establish a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It involves initial structural assessments, environmental impact studies, selection of appropriate crops, installation of modular soil beds, irrigation systems, and solar-powered sensors. The process integrates community engagement for educational workshops, pest control using organic methods, and a logistics plan for weekly harvesting and distribution to local markets. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure optimal growth conditions, while data analytics optimize yield and resource usage, promoting a closed-loop urban agriculture ecosystem.",
