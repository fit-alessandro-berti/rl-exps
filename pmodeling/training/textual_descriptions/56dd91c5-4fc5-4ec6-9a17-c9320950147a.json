  "title": "Urban Vertical Farm Setup",
  "description": "This process encompasses the complex steps required to establish an urban vertical farm within a repurposed industrial building. It involves site analysis, environmental impact assessment, modular system design, customized nutrient solution formulation, automated climate control integration, and multi-tier crop scheduling. The process also includes community engagement for local sourcing, advanced pest control strategies without pesticides, renewable energy system installation, IoT sensor calibration, workforce training on agri-tech tools, and continuous yield optimization through data analytics. Each activity is critical to ensuring a sustainable, high-efficiency farm that maximizes urban space while minimizing environmental footprint, enabling year-round crop production in dense metropolitan areas.",
