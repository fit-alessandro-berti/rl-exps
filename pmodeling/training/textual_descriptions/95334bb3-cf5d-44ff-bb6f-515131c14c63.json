  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a vertical farming system within an urban environment. It includes site analysis, modular infrastructure design, climatic control integration, nutrient cycle optimization, automated planting schedules, and energy-efficient lighting configurations. Additionally, it covers stakeholder coordination, regulatory compliance validation, waste recycling mechanisms, and data analytics for yield prediction, aiming to create a sustainable, high-yield urban agriculture solution that minimizes resource use and maximizes output within confined city spaces.",
