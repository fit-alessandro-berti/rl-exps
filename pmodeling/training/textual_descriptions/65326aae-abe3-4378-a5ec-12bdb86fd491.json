  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm. It includes site evaluation, structural assessments, and soil testing to ensure safety and feasibility. The process continues with irrigation system design, nutrient sourcing, and crop selection tailored for microclimates. It integrates community engagement, permits acquisition, and installation of renewable energy sources to minimize environmental impact. Ongoing monitoring of plant health, pest control using organic methods, and data collection for yield optimization complete the cycle. This atypical business process blends agriculture, engineering, and urban planning to create productive green spaces in dense urban environments, contributing to food security and ecological benefits.",
