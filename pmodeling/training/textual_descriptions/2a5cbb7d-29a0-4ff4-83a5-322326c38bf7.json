  "title": "Custom Drone Assembly",
  "description": "This process involves the design, sourcing, and assembly of custom drones tailored for specialized industrial applications such as agriculture, surveillance, and delivery. It begins with client requirement analysis, followed by prototype design and iterative testing. Components are sourced globally through a vetting process ensuring quality and compliance. Skilled technicians perform modular assembly, integrating avionics, propulsion, and sensor systems. Each unit undergoes rigorous calibration, flight simulation, and safety validation. The process concludes with packaging, client training, and after-sales support planning to ensure optimal operational performance and client satisfaction.",
