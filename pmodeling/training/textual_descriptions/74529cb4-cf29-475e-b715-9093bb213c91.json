It includes site evaluation, hive installation, periodic health inspections, pest control, honey extraction, and data reporting. The process integrates stakeholder communication, emergency response for hive disturbances, and educational outreach programs to promote awareness and support for urban pollinators. Each step is designed to minimize environmental impact while maximizing hive productivity and public safety, adapting dynamically to seasonal changes and urban challenges such as pollution and limited green spaces.",
