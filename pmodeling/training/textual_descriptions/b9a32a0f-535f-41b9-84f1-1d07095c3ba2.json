  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the intricate steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm within a densely populated city environment. It involves site analysis, modular system design, environmental control calibration, nutrient cycling optimization, and integration of renewable energy sources. Stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance, and sustainable waste management are also critical to ensure operational efficiency and minimize ecological impact. The process further includes technology installation, staff training, continuous monitoring, and iterative system adjustments to adapt to urban constraints and maximize crop yield in limited spaces.",
