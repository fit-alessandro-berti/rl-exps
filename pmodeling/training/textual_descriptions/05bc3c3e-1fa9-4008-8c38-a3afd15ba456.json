  "description": "This process governs the complex lifecycle of negotiating, drafting, and executing patent licenses across multiple jurisdictions with varying legal frameworks. It involves initial patent portfolio analysis, competitive landscape mapping, jurisdiction-specific compliance checks, risk assessments, drafting multi-region agreements, coordinating with local counsel, managing translation and localization of documents, handling royalty tracking and audit processes, and ensuring timely renewals and dispute resolutions. The process demands continuous collaboration between legal, technical, and financial teams to ensure alignment with global IP strategies while mitigating infringement risks and maximizing licensing revenue streams. It concludes with post-license performance reviews and adaptation to evolving regulatory environments.",
