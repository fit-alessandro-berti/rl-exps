  "title": "Cross-Domain Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process involves systematically integrating emerging technologies from unrelated industries to create breakthrough products. It starts with environmental scanning followed by hypothesis formulation and rapid prototyping. Cross-functional teams iterate through user feedback loops, intellectual property assessment, and scalability testing. The cycle includes compliance verification and strategic partnership alignment before final commercialization. Continuous knowledge transfer and post-launch analysis ensure sustained innovation and market relevance, making the process highly adaptive and multidisciplinary.",
