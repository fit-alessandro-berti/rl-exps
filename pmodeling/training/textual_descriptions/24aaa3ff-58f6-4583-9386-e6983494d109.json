  "title": "Collaborative Patent Filing",
  "description": "This process outlines the collaborative patent filing workflow in a multinational corporation involving cross-departmental coordination. It begins with invention disclosure and proceeds through prior art search, legal review, and strategic claim drafting. The workflow integrates iterative feedback loops among R&D, legal, and marketing teams to refine patent scope and applicability. Following internal approvals, the application undergoes formatting, electronic submission, and formal examination request. Post-filing, monitoring competitor filings and managing office actions ensure sustained patent prosecution. The process demands careful version control, confidentiality maintenance, and timely compliance with jurisdiction-specific regulations, culminating in patent grant and portfolio integration for commercialization support.",
