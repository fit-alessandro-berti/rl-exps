  "title": "Artisan Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process outlines the intricate steps involved in sourcing, crafting, and delivering bespoke artisan goods. It begins with raw material scouting in remote regions, followed by quality validation using non-standardized criteria. Artisans receive personalized design briefs, enabling handcrafting with adaptive techniques. Finished items undergo multi-stage authenticity and durability testing, including community feedback loops. Packaging is customized per client preferences using eco-friendly materials. The logistics phase integrates unconventional transport methods like local courier networks and barter exchanges. Finally, a post-delivery artisan-client interaction ensures satisfaction and future collaboration, fostering a sustainable and culturally rich business ecosystem that defies mainstream mass production models.",
