  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of an urban vertical farm within a repurposed industrial building. It involves site analysis, modular structure assembly, climate control system installation, nutrient solution preparation, and crop selection tailored to indoor environments. Continuous monitoring and automated adjustments optimize plant growth while integrating waste recycling and energy-saving mechanisms. The process concludes with harvesting protocols and market distribution planning, ensuring sustainable urban agriculture with minimal environmental impact and maximum yield efficiency.",
