  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process involves establishing a multi-tiered vertical farm within an urban environment, integrating advanced hydroponic systems, renewable energy sources, and AI-driven environmental controls. It requires site assessment, modular structure installation, nutrient solution formulation, crop selection tailored to microclimates, and continuous monitoring for optimal growth. Post-harvest activities include automated sorting, packaging, and distribution logistics coordinated with local markets. The process ensures sustainability by recycling water and organic waste while adapting dynamically to urban constraints and demand fluctuations, ultimately producing fresh produce with minimal carbon footprint.",
