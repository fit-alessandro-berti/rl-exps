  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and interdisciplinary steps required to establish a sustainable urban rooftop farm in a dense city environment. It involves initial site assessment, structural integrity analysis, microclimate evaluation, soil substrate preparation, irrigation system design, plant species selection optimized for urban conditions, installation of renewable energy sources, pest control planning with eco-friendly methods, community engagement and education programs, real-time environmental monitoring setup, harvest scheduling, waste composting integration, and finally, distribution logistics tailored to local markets and restaurants. Each activity requires careful coordination between architects, agronomists, engineers, and community stakeholders to ensure the project\u2019s viability and long-term impact on urban food security and green space enhancement.",
