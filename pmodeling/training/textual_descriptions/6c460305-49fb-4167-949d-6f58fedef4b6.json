  "description": "This process involves the intricate verification and authentication of rare historical artifacts for high-profile clients. It starts with initial provenance research, followed by multi-layered physical examinations including spectroscopy and carbon dating. Expert consultations are organized to validate findings, and legal compliance with international trade laws is ensured. Digital fingerprinting and blockchain registration provide immutable tracking, while insurance valuation and client briefing close the cycle. This atypical process demands coordination between archaeologists, legal experts, technologists, and insurers to guarantee authenticity and secure ownership transfer in a highly specialized market.",
