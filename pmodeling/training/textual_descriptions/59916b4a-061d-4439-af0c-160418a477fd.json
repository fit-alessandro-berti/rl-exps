  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of a vertical urban farm in a densely populated city environment. It integrates unconventional site selection, modular hydroponic system design, and multi-tiered crop scheduling. The process requires coordination between environmental impact analysis, energy optimization, and community engagement to ensure sustainable urban agriculture. Activities include securing rooftop leases, customizing nutrient delivery, implementing AI-driven climate control, and managing crop rotation cycles. The process culminates in local distribution partnerships and continuous feedback integration to enhance yield and reduce waste in an atypical but scalable urban farming operation.",
