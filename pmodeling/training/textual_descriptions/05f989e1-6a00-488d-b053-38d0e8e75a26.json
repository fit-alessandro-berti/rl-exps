  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process involves a cyclical approach to innovation that integrates insights from multiple unrelated industries to generate breakthrough products or services. It begins with trend spotting across diverse sectors, followed by cross-pollination workshops where teams share unconventional ideas. Next, rapid prototyping combines disparate technologies, which undergo iterative testing in simulated environments. Feedback loops incorporate external expert reviews and customer co-creation sessions to refine concepts. Concurrently, strategic alignment ensures business objectives are met while managing intellectual property risks. The cycle concludes with a staged launch plan involving phased market entry and continuous monitoring of competitive responses, enabling adaptive scaling and sustained innovation momentum.",
