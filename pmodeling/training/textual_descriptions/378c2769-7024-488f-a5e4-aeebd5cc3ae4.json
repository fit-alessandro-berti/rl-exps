  "title": "Custom Artifact Authentication",
  "description": "This process involves the authentication and validation of unique cultural artifacts destined for international auction. It begins with initial provenance research followed by multi-expert verification, material composition analysis, and advanced imaging inspections. Concurrently, legal compliance checks for cross-border transfers are conducted. If discrepancies arise, iterative consultations with historians occur. Once authenticated, the artifact undergoes secure packaging, insurance valuation, and digitized certification. Finally, the artifact is logged into a blockchain registry to ensure immutable provenance records before shipment to the auction house, ensuring transparency, security, and authenticity verification throughout the entire lifecycle.",
