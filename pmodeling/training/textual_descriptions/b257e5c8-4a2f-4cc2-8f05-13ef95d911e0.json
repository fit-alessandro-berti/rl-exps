  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing an urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It includes initial site evaluation, structural integrity checks, environmental impact assessments, securing permits from multiple authorities, designing modular planting systems, sourcing sustainable soil and water solutions, integrating IoT sensors for monitoring, training staff for urban agriculture techniques, marketing to local communities, and establishing supply chains for fresh produce distribution. The process ensures compliance with city regulations, maximizes yield in limited space, and promotes sustainable urban food production while addressing logistical and environmental challenges unique to rooftop farming.",
