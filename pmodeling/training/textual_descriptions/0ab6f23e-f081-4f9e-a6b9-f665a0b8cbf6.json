  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive steps required to establish an urban vertical farming system in a repurposed industrial building. It involves site analysis, environmental control design, modular system installation, nutrient solution calibration, and continuous monitoring. The process integrates IoT sensor deployment for real-time data collection, adaptive lighting adjustments, and automated pest management to optimize plant growth. Additionally, it incorporates community engagement for local sourcing, waste recycling strategies, and a scalable business model to ensure sustainable urban food production. Each activity ensures operational efficiency, resource conservation, and product quality in a complex, space-constrained urban environment.",
