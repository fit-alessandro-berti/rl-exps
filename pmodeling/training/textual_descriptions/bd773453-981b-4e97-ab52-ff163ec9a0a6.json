  "description": "This process outlines the complex and multifaceted steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm. It includes site assessment, structural analysis, soil preparation, microclimate evaluation, and installation of automated irrigation systems. The process also integrates community engagement, local regulatory compliance, crop selection based on seasonal data, and ongoing monitoring for pest control and yield optimization. Additionally, it incorporates waste recycling from the farm into compost, energy management through solar panels, and distribution logistics to local markets. The process ensures environmental sustainability while maximizing crop productivity in an unconventional urban environment.",
