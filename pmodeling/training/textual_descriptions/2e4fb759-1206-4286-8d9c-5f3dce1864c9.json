  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process describes the iterative cycle of cross-industry innovation where insights from disparate sectors are systematically gathered, synthesized, and applied to develop breakthrough products or services. It begins with environmental scanning and trend spotting across unrelated markets, followed by ideation sessions leveraging diverse expert panels. Concepts are rapidly prototyped using agile methodologies and tested through pilot programs in controlled environments. Feedback loops incorporate user data and expert reviews to refine solutions before scaling. The process also includes strategic partnerships formation, IP management, and continuous knowledge dissemination to ensure competitive advantage and sustainable innovation across industries.",
