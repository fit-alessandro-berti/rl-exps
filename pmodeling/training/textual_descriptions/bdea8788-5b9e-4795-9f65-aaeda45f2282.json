  "title": "Crowdsourced Disaster Response",
  "description": "This process coordinates rapid disaster response by leveraging a global network of volunteers, local authorities, and AI-driven resource allocation. It begins with hazard detection and public alerting, followed by volunteer mobilization through geotagged task assignments. Data from on-site volunteers is continuously aggregated and analyzed for situational awareness. Concurrently, supply chains are dynamically managed to deliver essential goods, while remote experts provide real-time guidance via digital platforms. The process integrates feedback loops to adapt resource allocation and volunteer deployment, ensuring efficient coverage despite unpredictable conditions and communication challenges. Post-event, the system facilitates impact assessment and lessons learned compilation for future preparedness.",
