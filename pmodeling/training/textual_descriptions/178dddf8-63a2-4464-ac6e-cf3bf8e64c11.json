  "title": "Artifact Authentication Workflow",
  "description": "This process involves the meticulous authentication and provenance verification of rare artifacts within a decentralized consortium of museums and private collectors. It begins with initial artifact intake and preliminary inspection, followed by multi-source historical data aggregation including archival documents, expert opinions, and scientific testing results. The process includes blockchain registration for immutable provenance records, advanced material composition analysis using spectrometry, and AI-driven stylistic comparison against established artifact databases. Discrepancies trigger a collaborative review session among curators and historians before final certification. Post-authentication, the artifact\u2019s digital twin is created and integrated into a virtual exhibit platform, enabling real-time condition monitoring and public accessibility while ensuring ongoing provenance validation through periodic re-assessment cycles.",
