  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive steps required to establish an urban rooftop farming operation in a densely populated city environment. It involves assessing the rooftop's structural integrity, obtaining necessary permits, designing modular planting systems, sourcing sustainable materials, installing irrigation and sensor networks, selecting crop varieties suited for microclimates, implementing pest management strategies, training local staff, and initiating a phased planting schedule. The process also includes continuous monitoring for environmental conditions and crop health, adaptive maintenance routines, harvesting logistics, and planning for seasonal crop rotation to maximize yield and sustainability within limited urban space constraints.",
