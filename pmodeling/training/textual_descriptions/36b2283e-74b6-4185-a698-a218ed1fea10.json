  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex sequence involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It includes initial site assessment for structural integrity and sunlight exposure, securing permits from local authorities, designing modular planting beds adapted to rooftop constraints, sourcing organic soil and seeds, installing automated drip irrigation systems powered by solar panels, integrating pest management strategies minimizing chemical use, scheduling crop rotation plans to optimize yield, training maintenance staff on crop care and system monitoring, implementing data collection for environmental factors, coordinating waste composting onsite, and finally launching a direct-to-consumer sales platform that connects urban residents with fresh produce. This atypical business process demands multidisciplinary coordination among architects, agronomists, engineers, and marketers to ensure both environmental sustainability and commercial viability in a constrained urban space.",
