  "description": "This process outlines the complex coordination required to establish a sustainable urban rooftop farm in a dense city environment. It involves initial site assessment, securing permits, designing modular planting systems, sourcing eco-friendly materials, installing irrigation and solar power, recruiting local volunteers, conducting soil and air quality tests, and establishing supply chains for seeds and organic fertilizers. After installation, the farm undergoes regular maintenance, pest monitoring, and community engagement activities to ensure productivity and environmental compliance. The process concludes with periodic harvest cycles and distribution logistics to local markets and restaurants, emphasizing sustainability and social impact throughout.",
