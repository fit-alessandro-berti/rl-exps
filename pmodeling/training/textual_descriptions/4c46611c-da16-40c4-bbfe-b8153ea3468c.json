  "description": "This process manages the end-to-end supply chain of an urban vertical farming operation, integrating automated planting, environmental monitoring, nutrient delivery, and harvest scheduling with downstream distribution logistics. It involves coordination between IoT sensors, AI-driven growth optimization, quality inspections, packaging automation, and last-mile delivery to retailers and consumers within a metropolitan area. The process ensures minimal waste, energy efficiency, and freshness, while adapting dynamically to demand fluctuations and seasonal variations, requiring continuous data analysis and prompt decision-making across multiple departments and external partners.",
