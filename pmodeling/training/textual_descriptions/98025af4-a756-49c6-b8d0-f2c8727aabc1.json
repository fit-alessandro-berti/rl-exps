  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of a sustainable urban rooftop farm in a dense metropolitan area. It involves initial feasibility studies including structural integrity assessments, microclimate analysis, and community engagement. Following approvals, the process continues with soil-less media selection, irrigation system design, and seed sourcing tailored to urban conditions. Subsequent activities address installation of modular planters, integration of renewable energy sources, pest management using biological controls, and continuous monitoring via IoT sensors. The process concludes with crop harvesting, distribution logistics optimized for local markets, and iterative feedback collection to improve future cycles. This atypical yet practical approach merges urban planning, agriculture, and technology to enhance food security and urban greening.",
