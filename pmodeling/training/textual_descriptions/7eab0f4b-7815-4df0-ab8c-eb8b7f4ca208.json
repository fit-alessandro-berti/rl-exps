  "description": "This process involves the creation and management of a corporate time capsule intended to preserve company culture, achievements, and predictions for future employees. The process starts with idea generation and asset collection, followed by authentication and cataloging of items. Afterward, it requires coordination with legal and archival teams to ensure compliance and preservation standards. Packaging and secure sealing of the capsule precede the selection of a physical or digital storage location. Finally, formal documentation and a future opening protocol are established to guarantee the capsule's integrity and relevance over decades, involving periodic reviews and updates to the contents as the company evolves.",
