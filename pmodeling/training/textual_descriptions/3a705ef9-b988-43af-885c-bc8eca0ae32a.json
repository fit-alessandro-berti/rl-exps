  "title": "Adaptive Art Auction",
  "description": "This process manages a dynamic art auction where artworks are continuously evaluated by AI algorithms for authenticity and market trends while bidders participate both physically and virtually. The system integrates real-time sentiment analysis from social media, adjusts bidding increments based on demand elasticity, and automatically reallocates auction lots to optimize final sale prices. Post-auction, the system arranges provenance verification, coordinates logistics with specialized art handlers, and triggers personalized marketing campaigns for unsold pieces. This atypical auction process blends technology-driven valuation, multi-channel engagement, and adaptive inventory management to maximize revenue and collector satisfaction in a fluctuating art market.",
