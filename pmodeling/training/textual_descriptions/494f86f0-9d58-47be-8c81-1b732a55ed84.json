  "description": "This process involves integrating unconventional insights from multiple industries to generate breakthrough products or services. It starts by scouting emerging trends across unrelated sectors, followed by collaborative ideation sessions where cross-functional teams reinterpret these insights. Rapid prototyping and iterative testing occur in simulated environments, incorporating real-time data from pilot markets. Feedback loops include external expert evaluations and adaptive refinement of concepts. Final steps encompass strategic alignment with corporate goals and phased market introduction, ensuring scalability and cross-sector adaptability while managing regulatory and cultural nuances effectively.",
