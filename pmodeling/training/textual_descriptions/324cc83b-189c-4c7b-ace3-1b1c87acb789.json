  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process outlines a cyclical approach to fostering innovation by integrating insights and technologies across unrelated industries. It begins with environmental scanning to identify emerging trends outside the core domain, followed by ideation sessions that leverage cross-sector expertise. Concept prototyping is done rapidly using agile methodologies, incorporating feedback from diverse stakeholders. The process includes periodic knowledge transfer workshops, external partnership development, and iterative refinement based on pilot results. Risk assessment and scalability evaluation ensure feasibility before full-scale implementation. Continuous learning loops from market response data feed back into future cycle iterations, promoting sustained innovation beyond traditional boundaries.",
