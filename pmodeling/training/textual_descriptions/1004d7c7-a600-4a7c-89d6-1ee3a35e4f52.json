  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm within a repurposed commercial building. It includes assessing structural integrity, designing modular growing units, integrating IoT sensors for climate control, selecting crop varieties optimized for vertical growth, installing hydroponic systems, and implementing automated nutrient delivery. The process further involves regulatory compliance checks, staff training on specialized farming techniques, continuous environmental monitoring, and establishing supply chain logistics for fresh produce distribution to local markets. Emphasis is placed on sustainability and energy efficiency throughout the setup.",
