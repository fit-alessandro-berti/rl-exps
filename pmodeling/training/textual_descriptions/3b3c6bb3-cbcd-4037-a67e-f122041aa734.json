  "title": "Corporate Artifact Exchange",
  "description": "This process governs the secure and confidential exchange of proprietary artifacts between multinational corporations involved in joint ventures. It includes authentication, artifact classification, risk assessment, encryption, transfer approval, and compliance verification. The process ensures traceability and audit readiness, balancing intellectual property protection with collaboration efficiency. Each artifact undergoes integrity checks and metadata tagging before and after transit, involving multiple stakeholders such as legal, IT security, and project management. Post-transfer, reconciliation and feedback collection optimize future exchanges and mitigate potential disputes, making the process essential for maintaining trust and operational continuity in complex business ecosystems.",
