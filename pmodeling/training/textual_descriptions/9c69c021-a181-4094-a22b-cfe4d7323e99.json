  "title": "Artisan Perfume Launch",
  "description": "This process involves the creation and market introduction of a niche artisan perfume line. Beginning with raw botanical sourcing from remote locations, the workflow includes scent formulation through iterative blending cycles, stability testing under varying environmental conditions, packaging design aligned with sustainable principles, and limited batch production using traditional methods. Following quality assurance, the marketing team crafts immersive storytelling campaigns targeting select luxury boutiques, followed by influencer collaboration and exclusive launch events. Post-launch, customer feedback is gathered via curated channels to inform future iterations and maintain brand authenticity in a competitive artisan space.",
