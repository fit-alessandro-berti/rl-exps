  "title": "Corporate Artifact Repurposing",
  "description": "This process involves the systematic identification, acquisition, and transformation of obsolete corporate artifacts such as outdated technology hardware, legacy software modules, and discontinued branded materials. The objective is to creatively repurpose these assets into new, value-generating products or services that align with current market demands. The process encompasses cross-departmental collaboration, including asset auditing, feasibility analysis, design prototyping, regulatory compliance checks, and stakeholder approvals. It further integrates sustainability assessments to ensure environmental impact is minimized. The final phase involves pilot testing, market feedback incorporation, and scaled production rollout, thereby extending the lifecycle of corporate assets while fostering innovation and reducing waste.",
