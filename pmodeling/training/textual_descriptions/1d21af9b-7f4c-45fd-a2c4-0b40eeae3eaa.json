  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and atypical steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farming system within a dense metropolitan environment. It includes site evaluation for structural integrity, microclimate assessment, integration of automated hydroponic systems, real-time nutrient monitoring, energy optimization using renewable sources, vertical crop rotation planning, waste recycling loops, IoT sensor calibration, pest control through bioengineering, and community engagement for local food distribution. The process ensures sustainable food production while balancing technology, environment, and urban constraints.",
