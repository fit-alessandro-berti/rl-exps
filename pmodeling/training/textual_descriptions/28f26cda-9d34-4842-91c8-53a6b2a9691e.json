  "title": "Cross-Industry Innovation Cycle",
  "description": "This process describes a cross-industry innovation cycle where ideas originating in one sector are systematically adapted and integrated into a different industry to create novel products or services. It involves identifying transferable concepts, conducting feasibility analyses, securing multi-sector partnerships, prototyping with hybrid teams, and navigating complex regulatory environments unique to each industry. Continuous feedback loops from diverse market segments are incorporated to refine solutions. The cycle culminates in scalable deployment plans that leverage combined supply chains and shared intellectual property management to maximize impact and sustainability across sectors.",
