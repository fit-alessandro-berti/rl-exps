  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of an urban rooftop farm, integrating architectural assessments, environmental impact studies, and community engagement. It involves selecting suitable crops, designing modular planting systems, installing irrigation and lighting technologies, and coordinating with local authorities for compliance. The process also includes soil preparation using recycled materials, pest management through natural predators, and setting up data collection for crop monitoring. Post-installation, it emphasizes training staff, marketing the farm produce to local markets, and evaluating sustainability metrics to ensure long-term viability and community benefits.",
