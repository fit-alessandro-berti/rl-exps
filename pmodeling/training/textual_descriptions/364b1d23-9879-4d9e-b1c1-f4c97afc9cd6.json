  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and innovative steps involved in establishing a fully operational urban vertical farm within a repurposed industrial building. It includes site assessment, climate control system design, modular planting structure assembly, nutrient recycling setup, automation integration for irrigation and lighting, pest management protocols, and real-time data analytics deployment. The workflow ensures sustainability through energy efficiency, waste minimization, and crop yield optimization, while addressing urban zoning regulations and community engagement for local produce distribution. This atypical but realistic process requires multidisciplinary coordination among architects, agronomists, engineers, and IT specialists to successfully create a scalable vertical farming ecosystem in a constrained urban environment.",
