# Description: This process involves sourcing rare milk varieties from micro-dairies, performing microbial culture selection, and carefully controlling aging conditions to produce unique artisan cheeses. It includes quality testing, packaging in eco-friendly materials, coordinating limited batch logistics, and managing niche market demand forecasts. The process requires close collaboration with local farmers, regulatory compliance checks, and continuous product innovation to maintain exclusivity and high standards in a competitive gourmet market.
