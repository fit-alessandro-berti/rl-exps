# Description: This process involves transforming underutilized urban rooftop spaces into productive agricultural environments. It includes assessing structural integrity, designing modular planting systems, sourcing sustainable materials, integrating automated irrigation and nutrient delivery, and coordinating with local regulations. The process also covers community workshops, environmental impact assessments, pest management, and harvesting logistics to ensure a thriving, eco-friendly rooftop farm that supports local food production and urban biodiversity.
