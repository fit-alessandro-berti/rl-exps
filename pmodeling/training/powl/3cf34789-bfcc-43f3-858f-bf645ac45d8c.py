# Description: This process manages the identification, evaluation, and integration of breakthrough technologies from unrelated industries into existing business models. It begins with cross-sector scouting to discover novel ideas outside the companyâ€™s domain, followed by multidisciplinary feasibility analysis involving experts from various fields. The process continues with iterative prototyping and pilot testing in controlled environments, ensuring adaptability and scalability. Strategic partnerships are established to leverage external capabilities and intellectual property. Market simulation and risk assessment are conducted concurrently to anticipate potential challenges. Finally, the process culminates in phased rollout plans and continuous feedback loops to refine the innovation and maximize impact across multiple business units, fostering sustained competitive advantage through unconventional innovation sources.
