# Description: This process outlines the unique and intricate supply chain for artisanal cheese production, involving sourcing rare milk types, carefully timed fermentation, handcrafted molding, aging under controlled humidity, and specialized packaging. The process requires coordination between small-scale farmers, fermentation experts, quality inspectors, and boutique distributors to ensure the final product maintains its distinct flavor profile and meets niche market demands while complying with strict food safety regulations and seasonal variations in milk availability.
