# Description: This process details the comprehensive steps involved in establishing an urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It includes assessing structural integrity, navigating local regulations, designing modular planting systems, sourcing sustainable materials, installing irrigation and solar-powered monitoring devices, training staff on urban agriculture techniques, implementing pest management strategies, and setting up a direct-to-consumer sales platform. The process ensures environmental compliance, maximizes crop yield in limited space, and integrates technology for efficient farm management while fostering community engagement through workshops and events.
