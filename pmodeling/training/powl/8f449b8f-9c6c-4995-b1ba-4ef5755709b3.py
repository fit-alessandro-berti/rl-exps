# Description: This process outlines the comprehensive steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm within a repurposed industrial building. It includes site assessment, environmental control system design, hydroponic installation, crop cycle planning, nutrient solution optimization, and integration of IoT monitoring devices. Additional activities cover pest management strategies, staff training on automated systems, marketing of fresh produce to local businesses, and ongoing data analysis for yield improvement. The process ensures sustainable urban agriculture by maximizing space efficiency, reducing water usage, and promoting local food production in an atypical but realistic business model.
