  "description": "Start by enjoying your perfectly creamy Spaghetti Carbonara, savoring every bite. Then you plate the dish, garnishing it with Parmesan and black pepper. After this, you mix the hot pasta, egg mixture, and crispy pancetta to coat evenly. Then you pour the egg yolk and cheese mixture over the spaghetti, tossing rapidly to avoid scrambling. Next, you boil the spaghetti until al dente, saving some pasta water. This is followed by whisking egg yolks, Parmesan, and black pepper into a creamy sauce and saut\u00c3\u00a9ing pancetta until crispy. Then make a pot of salted water boil, while gathering your ingredients: spaghetti, eggs, Parmesan, pancetta, and seasonings. Finally, start planning how to cook a perfect plate of Carbonara.",
