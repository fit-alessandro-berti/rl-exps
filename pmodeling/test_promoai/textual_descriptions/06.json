  "description": "This process begins when a customer places an order through an online platform or over the phone. The system automatically generates an order confirmation and sends it to the customer. The warehouse team picks and packs the items, and a shipping label is generated. The order is then handed over to a logistics provider for delivery. Tracking information is sent to the customer. The process continues as the shipment is monitored until it reaches the customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address. After successful delivery, the process ends, but customer feedback or returns may trigger further actions.",
