  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of a fully automated urban vertical farm within a repurposed high-rise building. It involves site evaluation, modular system design, climate control calibration, seed selection, hydroponic nutrient optimization, robotic planting, continuous environmental monitoring, pest detection through AI, data-driven growth analysis, automated harvesting, packaging customization, waste recycling integration, energy consumption auditing, and real-time market demand alignment. The goal is to create a sustainable, high-yield farm capable of responding dynamically to urban food supply needs while minimizing ecological footprint and operational costs.",
