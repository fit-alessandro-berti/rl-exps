  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process outlines the end-to-end operations of an urban vertical farming supply chain, integrating advanced hydroponics, automated harvesting, and AI-driven demand forecasting. It begins with seed selection and nutrient formulation, followed by controlled environment monitoring and pest detection using IoT sensors. Crops are then harvested via robotic arms, quality-checked by computer vision systems, and packaged in biodegradable containers. Distribution leverages micro-fulfillment centers to enable rapid delivery to local markets while minimizing carbon footprint. Feedback loops from consumer preferences inform adaptive crop planning and resource allocation, ensuring sustainability and profitability in a complex urban agricultural ecosystem.",
