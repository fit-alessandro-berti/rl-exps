  "description": "This process involves the intricate creation of custom artisan perfumes tailored to individual client preferences. Starting from scent profiling, raw ingredient sourcing, and quality assessment, it moves through experimental blending, maturation cycles, and sensory evaluation by expert panels. The process incorporates iterative refinement and stability testing to ensure product consistency. Packaging design and limited edition batch coordination add exclusivity, while compliance checks and market feedback loops optimize the final offering. This atypical process merges creativity, chemistry, and customer collaboration to deliver unique fragrance experiences.",
