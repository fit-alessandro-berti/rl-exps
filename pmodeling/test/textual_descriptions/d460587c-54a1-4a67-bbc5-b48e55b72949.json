  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It includes initial structural assessments, securing permits, soil and water testing, installation of hydroponic systems, integration of renewable energy sources, crop selection based on microclimate data, stakeholder coordination, ongoing environmental monitoring, and market launch strategies. The process ensures compliance with city regulations, maximizes yield efficiency, and incorporates community engagement initiatives to promote urban agriculture awareness and education. It requires interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, agronomists, architects, and local authorities to successfully transform unused rooftop spaces into productive green environments that contribute to local food security and urban ecosystem enhancement.",
