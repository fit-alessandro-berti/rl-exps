  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the intricate steps involved in establishing an urban vertical farm within a confined city environment. It integrates advanced hydroponic and aeroponic systems, sustainable energy solutions, and IoT sensors for real-time monitoring. The workflow includes site assessment, modular unit assembly, nutrient solution calibration, seed selection based on microclimate data, pest control via biological agents, and continuous yield optimization using AI-driven analytics. The process further encompasses community engagement, regulatory compliance checks, and scalable expansion planning to ensure sustainable urban agriculture that minimizes resource usage and maximizes output in limited spaces.",
