  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive steps required to establish a vertical farming system within an urban environment. It involves site analysis, modular design, environmental control calibration, nutrient solution preparation, seed selection, crop scheduling, automated monitoring, pest management, data analytics integration, and supply chain coordination. The process ensures optimized plant growth through controlled lighting, humidity, and temperature, while incorporating sustainable resource management and waste recycling. Stakeholder engagement and regulatory compliance are integrated to meet urban agricultural standards and community expectations, aiming for high yield and minimal environmental impact.",
