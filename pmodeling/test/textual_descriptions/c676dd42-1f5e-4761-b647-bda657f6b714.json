  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex establishment of an urban vertical farming facility integrating hydroponics and IoT technology. It involves site analysis, modular design, nutrient solution management, sensor calibration, climate control optimization, waste recycling, and automated harvesting. The goal is to maximize crop yield in a limited space while maintaining sustainability through energy-efficient systems, data-driven growth monitoring, and community engagement programs. This atypical process requires coordination between agricultural scientists, engineers, software developers, and urban planners to create a self-sustaining ecosystem within a city environment.",
