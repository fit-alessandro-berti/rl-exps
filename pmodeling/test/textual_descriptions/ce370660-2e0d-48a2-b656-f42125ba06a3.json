  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of a sustainable urban rooftop farm on a commercial building. It involves initial structural assessments to ensure load capacity, followed by modular soil bed installation adapted for limited space. Specialized irrigation systems are integrated to optimize water usage, alongside solar-powered sensors for real-time monitoring of crop health. The process also includes obtaining necessary permits, community engagement for local support, and coordinated logistics for seed and nutrient delivery. Finally, staff training on hydroponic techniques and ongoing maintenance schedules ensure the farm\u2019s productivity and environmental benefits are maximized throughout the year.",
