  "title": "Urban Beekeeping Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex supply chain and operational workflow for an urban beekeeping business that produces honey, beeswax products, and educational services. It involves sourcing specialized urban-friendly bee colonies, adapting hive designs for rooftop and balcony installations, monitoring hive health with IoT sensors, harvesting honey safely without disrupting urban environments, processing raw materials in small-scale urban facilities, packaging with eco-friendly materials, managing direct-to-consumer deliveries via bicycle couriers, coordinating educational workshops for city residents, and ensuring compliance with municipal regulations. The process also integrates community engagement activities and data-driven hive maintenance schedules to optimize yield while minimizing environmental impact in dense city areas.",
