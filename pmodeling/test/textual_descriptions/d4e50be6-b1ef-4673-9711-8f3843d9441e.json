  "title": "Patent Monetization Workflow",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in identifying, evaluating, and monetizing intellectual property assets through licensing, partnerships, or sales. It begins with patent scouting to discover viable patents, followed by technical and legal due diligence. Market analysis identifies potential licensees or buyers, and valuation models estimate patent worth. Negotiations and contract drafting establish terms, while portfolio management tracks ongoing performance. Post-deal compliance ensures adherence to agreements, and continuous innovation monitoring detects new opportunities or risks, making this a multifaceted business process combining legal, technical, and commercial expertise.",
