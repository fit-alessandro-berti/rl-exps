  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps required to establish an urban vertical farming system within a densely populated city environment. It involves site assessment, environmental analysis, modular structure assembly, hydroponic system integration, nutrient solution calibration, automated climate control installation, energy optimization, crop selection based on urban demand, pest management without chemicals, data-driven growth monitoring, harvest scheduling, waste recycling, community engagement, and finally, market distribution coordination. Each phase requires close collaboration between agronomists, engineers, urban planners, and supply chain experts to ensure sustainability, efficiency, and profitability in limited urban spaces.",
