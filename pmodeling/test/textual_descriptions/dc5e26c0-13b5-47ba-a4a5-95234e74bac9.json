  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of a fully integrated urban vertical farming system within a repurposed industrial building. It involves site analysis, modular system design, climate control integration, IoT sensor deployment for real-time monitoring, nutrient solution preparation, automation programming, crop scheduling, pest management without chemicals, energy optimization through renewable sources, waste recycling, multi-tier planting, harvest logistics, and community engagement strategies. The goal is to maximize yield per square foot while minimizing environmental impact and operational costs in a densely populated urban setting.",
