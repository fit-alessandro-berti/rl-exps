  "title": "Artisanal Perfume Creation",
  "description": "This process involves the intricate crafting of bespoke perfumes using rare botanical extracts and traditional techniques. It begins with raw material sourcing from remote locations, followed by precise extraction methods such as enfleurage or steam distillation. The next steps include blending scent accords, aging the mixture to develop complexity, and iterative olfactory testing to ensure balance and uniqueness. Packaging is customized with artisan labels and hand-blown bottles. Quality control includes sensory panels and stability tests before limited edition release. The process demands coordination between botanists, chemists, and craftsmen, ensuring each perfume reflects distinctive artistry and exceptional quality.",
