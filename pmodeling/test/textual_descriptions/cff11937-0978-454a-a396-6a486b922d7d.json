The process includes quality sampling, custom packaging design, cold-chain logistics coordination, market trend analysis for flavor adjustments, direct-to-consumer sales via pop-up events, and feedback incorporation for continuous product refinement. It ensures the preservation of traditional methods while leveraging modern technology for traceability and customer engagement.",
