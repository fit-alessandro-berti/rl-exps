  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm in a densely populated city. It includes site analysis, structural assessment, microclimate evaluation, soil preparation with hydroponic integration, seed selection tailored to urban conditions, installation of automated irrigation and nutrient delivery systems, pest monitoring using AI-driven sensors, community engagement for resource sharing, regulatory compliance checks, and the establishment of a local distribution network for produce. The process ensures optimization of limited space, maximizes yield through technology, and fosters urban food security by integrating environmental, technical, and social considerations.",
