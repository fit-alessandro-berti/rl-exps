  "title": "Custom Drone Assembly",
  "description": "This process involves the end-to-end assembly of custom drones tailored to specific client requirements. It starts with requirement gathering and design customization, followed by sourcing specialized components, firmware configuration, precision mechanical assembly, and multi-stage quality assurance. Each drone undergoes individual flight calibration and environmental testing before packaging. The process also includes software integration, remote control pairing, and final documentation. Post-assembly, the drones are registered for regulatory compliance and scheduled for client training sessions, ensuring full operational readiness and support.",
