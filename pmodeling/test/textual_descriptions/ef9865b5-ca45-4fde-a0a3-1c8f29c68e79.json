It includes site assessment for structural integrity and sunlight exposure, obtaining necessary permits, designing modular planting systems, sourcing sustainable materials, installing irrigation and sensor networks, recruiting skilled urban farmers, conducting soil-less planting trials, implementing pest management strategies, and setting up a digital monitoring platform. The process concludes with initial harvest planning and community engagement activities aimed at promoting urban agriculture benefits and local food sourcing awareness.",
