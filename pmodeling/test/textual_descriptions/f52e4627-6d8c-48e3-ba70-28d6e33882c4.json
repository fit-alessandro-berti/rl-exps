  "title": "Artisan Coffee Sourcing",
  "description": "This process involves sourcing rare, single-origin coffee beans directly from small-scale farmers across remote regions. It includes detailed farm assessments, quality verification through cupping sessions, and sustainability audits. The process requires negotiation of fair-trade contracts, coordination of logistics for fragile shipments, and continuous relationship management to ensure consistent supply and ethical practices. Additionally, it integrates seasonal forecasting and adaptive procurement strategies to account for climate variability affecting harvests, all while maintaining brand exclusivity and traceability from farm to cup.",
