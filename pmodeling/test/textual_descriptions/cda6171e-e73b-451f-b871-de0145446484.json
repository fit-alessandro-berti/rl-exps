  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the establishment of an urban vertical farm within a repurposed industrial building. It involves site analysis, structural modifications, environmental control installations, hydroponic system setup, nutrient solution preparation, seed selection, automated planting, growth monitoring via IoT sensors, pest control using integrated biological methods, energy optimization through smart grid integration, water recycling implementation, harvesting automation, packaging with minimal waste materials, distribution logistics coordination, and post-harvest data analysis to improve yield efficiency. Each step requires cross-disciplinary collaboration among architects, agronomists, engineers, and supply chain specialists to adapt traditional farming techniques to a compact, sustainable, and tech-driven urban environment.",
