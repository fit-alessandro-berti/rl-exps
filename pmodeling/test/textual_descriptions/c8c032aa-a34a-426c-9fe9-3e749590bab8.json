  "title": "Vertical Farming Supply Chain",
  "description": "This process describes the complex and atypical supply chain management for a vertical farming business that integrates urban agriculture with high-tech systems. It involves sourcing specialized LED lights, hydroponic nutrients, and climate control components, coordinating with local urban suppliers, scheduling growth cycles based on predictive analytics, managing energy consumption through smart grids, conducting quality inspections at multiple growth stages, and orchestrating last-mile delivery to urban retailers and direct consumers. The process also includes handling unexpected events such as equipment failure, pest outbreaks, and fluctuating market demands, requiring real-time adjustments and cross-functional collaboration between agronomists, logistics teams, and IT specialists to maintain product quality and optimize sustainability.",
