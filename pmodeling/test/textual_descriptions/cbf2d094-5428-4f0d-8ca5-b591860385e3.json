  "title": "Urban Vertical Farming Cycle",
  "description": "This process outlines the comprehensive cycle of an urban vertical farming operation that integrates automated hydroponics with AI-driven crop monitoring to optimize yield in constrained city environments. Starting from seed selection and nutrient calibration, the process includes climate control adjustments, robotic planting, pest bio-control application, and continuous growth analytics. Harvesting is synchronized with demand forecasting to minimize waste, followed by post-harvest sterilization and packaging. Finally, logistics coordination ensures fresh delivery to local markets, while data feedback loops refine future crop cycles for sustainability and efficiency improvements in urban agriculture.",
