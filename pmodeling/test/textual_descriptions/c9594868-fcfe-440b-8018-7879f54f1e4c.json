  "description": "This process outlines the atypical business workflow for establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm on commercial buildings. It involves site evaluation, structural assessment, soil and hydroponic system design, regulatory compliance checks, sourcing eco-friendly materials, community engagement, installation, crop selection tailored to urban climate, ongoing monitoring with IoT sensors, pest management using organic methods, harvest scheduling, and finally, direct-to-consumer distribution through local markets and digital platforms, ensuring a closed-loop, environmentally conscious urban agriculture initiative.",
