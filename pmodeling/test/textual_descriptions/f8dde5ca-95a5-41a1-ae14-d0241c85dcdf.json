  "title": "Rare Artifact Authentication",
  "description": "This process involves a multi-disciplinary approach to authenticate rare artifacts sourced from various global locations. It begins with preliminary provenance checks, followed by advanced material analysis using spectrometry and radiocarbon dating. Specialists then perform stylistic comparisons against extensive historical databases. Concurrently, blockchain registration is prepared to ensure traceability. Legal consultants review ownership legitimacy while conservators assess preservation needs. Finally, a comprehensive report is compiled, validated by an expert panel, and submitted to both the client and relevant cultural heritage authorities to ensure compliance and facilitate potential acquisition or exhibition.",
