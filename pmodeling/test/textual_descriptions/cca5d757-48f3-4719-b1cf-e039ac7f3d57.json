  "title": "Urban Rooftop Farming Setup",
  "description": "This process outlines the complex and multifaceted approach to establishing a sustainable urban rooftop farm in a densely populated cityscape. It involves site assessment for structural integrity, microclimate analysis, soil-less medium preparation, modular bed installation, automated irrigation setup, crop selection based on seasonal and local demand, pest management using integrated natural methods, community engagement for educational workshops, digital monitoring system deployment, waste recycling integration, seasonal yield forecasting, and finally distribution channel establishment through local markets and restaurants. This atypical yet realistic process requires cross-disciplinary coordination between architects, agronomists, technologists, and community organizers to ensure a productive, eco-friendly, and economically viable rooftop farming venture.",
