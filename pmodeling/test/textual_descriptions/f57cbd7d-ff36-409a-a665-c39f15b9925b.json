  "title": "Corporate Innovation Pipeline",
  "description": "This process outlines the end-to-end flow for managing corporate innovation projects that deviate from traditional R&D workflows. It begins with external trend scanning and internal ideation sprints, followed by cross-departmental feasibility reviews and risk assessments. Selected ideas progress through rapid prototyping using minimal viable technologies, then undergo market simulation and stakeholder alignment workshops. Post-validation, projects enter a resource allocation phase involving budget rebalancing and talent sourcing, before moving into iterative pilot launches with continuous data-driven refinements. The process concludes with scalability analysis and integration planning to embed successful innovations into existing business units while managing change and knowledge transfer effectively across teams.",
