  "title": "Drone Fleet Maintenance",
  "description": "This process governs the comprehensive maintenance cycle for a fleet of autonomous delivery drones operating in diverse urban environments. It includes pre-flight diagnostics, environmental adaptation calibrations, in-flight anomaly detection, post-mission data analysis, battery health optimization, dynamic route reconfiguration, and regulatory compliance reporting. The workflow integrates real-time telemetry monitoring with predictive analytics to minimize downtime and extend drone lifecycle. Specialized activities involve firmware patch deployment, sensor recalibration, damage assessment from minor collisions, and end-of-day performance summarization, ensuring operational efficiency and safety standards are continuously met across all units.",
