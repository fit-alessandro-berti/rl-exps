# Description: This process outlines the establishment of an urban rooftop farm on commercial buildings, integrating environmental assessments, resource logistics, and community engagement. It involves evaluating structural integrity, selecting crop varieties suited for microclimates, installing irrigation systems, and coordinating with local authorities for compliance. Continuous monitoring of soil health and pest control is combined with marketing strategies to promote farm-to-table initiatives. The process also includes training sessions for staff and residents, waste recycling protocols, and seasonal harvest planning to maximize yield while ensuring sustainability and social impact within densely populated urban areas.
