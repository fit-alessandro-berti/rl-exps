# Note: The order between nodes is not explicitly defined in the provided text.
# For a complete model, the dependencies (edges) between nodes would need to be specified.
# Here, we've just created the nodes and the root structure.
# The actual dependencies (edges) between the nodes would need to be added based on the process flow.
# For example, the 'Site Survey' and 'Structural Check' might be concurrent, so we might have:
# root.order.add_edge(site_survey, structural_check)
# root.order.add_edge(site_survey, structural_check)
# This would depend on the actual process flow described in the text.

# The 'root' variable now contains the POWL model for the urban vertical farm process.
