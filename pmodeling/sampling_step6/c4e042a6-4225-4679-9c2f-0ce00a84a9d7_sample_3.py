# Add dependencies if any specific sequence or concurrency is required
# For example, if 'Supplier Audit' must come before 'Material Sourcing'
# root.order.add_edge(supplier_audit, material_sourcing)

# If you want to add more complex dependencies, you can use the order.add_edge method
# For instance, if 'Quality Review' must come after 'Prototype Build'
# root.order.add_edge(prototype_build, quality_review)

# If you want to add concurrency, you can use the order.add_edge method with the same source and target
# For instance, if 'Material Sourcing' and 'Supplier Audit' can occur concurrently
# root.order.add_edge(material_sourcing, supplier_audit)
# root.order.add_edge(supplier_audit, material_sourcing)

# The above dependencies are just examples and you may need to adjust them based on the actual process flow.
# The dependencies should be added as per the specific requirements of the supply chain management process.

# The final POWL model is stored in the 'root' variable.
