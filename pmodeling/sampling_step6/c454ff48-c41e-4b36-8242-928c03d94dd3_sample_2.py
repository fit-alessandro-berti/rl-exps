# Define dependencies between activities (POWL model structure)
# This is a placeholder; in a real scenario, you would add more dependencies based on the actual process flow.
# For example:
# root.order.add_edge(site_assess, permit_obtain)
# root.order.add_edge(site_assess, soil_testing)
# root.order.add_edge(site_assess, crop_select)
# ...

# The dependencies are not explicitly defined in the provided example, but they should be added based on the process flow.
# This is just a template; you would need to add the appropriate dependencies based on the process flow.
# For instance, you might want to have site_assess precede permit_obtain, and soil_testing precede crop_select, etc.
# The dependencies should be added to the 'root.order' attribute of the StrictPartialOrder object.

# Now, 'root' contains the POWL model for the process.
# You can use this model for further analysis or visualization.
